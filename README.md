# Zotero Tutorial

This is a tutorial for the paper organizing software [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). [Here](https://github.com/Empyreal092/Zotero_Tutorial/blob/main/Presentation.pdf) is the slide, and [here](https://github.com/Empyreal092/Zotero_Tutorial/blob/main/latex/Zotero_Tutorial_LaTeX.pdf) is the accompanying LaTeX example.
I will show my workflow as an example of what is possible with Zotero. There are high degrees of customizability with Zotero, thus I could not show all its amazingness. I hope what I show will help the initial learning curve for Zotero and encourage the reader to explore it further. 
In short, I will cover the "pipeline" of import-organize-cite papers. I will make use of [plug-ins](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) for Zotero such as [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/), [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), and [Zutilo](https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo). 

## Acknowledgement
This slide was made in Spring 2022 for the "How-to Day" talk at [Modeling & Simulation Group (MSG) Meeting](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/research/pages/research-and-training-group-mathematical-modeling-and-simulation/activities/group-meeting/?semester_code=spring-2022), Courant Institute, NYU. I thank the organizer for the opportunity.
I make this repository public and plan to keep it updated, hoping that it could be a useful resource for all interested.
